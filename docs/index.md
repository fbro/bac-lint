# Introduction

The Spectral lint ruleset is a powerful tool used in Backstage to enforce code quality and best practices. It provides a set of predefined rules that can be applied to various types of files, such as YAML, JSON, and Markdown.

By using the Spectral lint ruleset, developers can ensure that their code adheres to a consistent style, follows industry standards, and avoids common mistakes. This helps to improve the overall quality of the codebase and makes it easier to maintain and collaborate on projects.

Spectral provides a wide range of rules that cover different aspects of code quality, including formatting, naming conventions, security vulnerabilities, and more. These rules can be customized and extended to fit the specific needs of a project.

In addition to the predefined rules, Spectral also allows developers to define their own custom rules. This gives them the flexibility to enforce project-specific requirements and guidelines.

By integrating the Spectral lint ruleset into the development workflow, teams can catch potential issues early on and ensure that their code meets the highest standards of quality.

To get started with the Spectral lint ruleset in Backstage, refer to the documentation for detailed instructions on installation and configuration.
